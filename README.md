# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## 1 Index pg
    * Load into Start button
    * Video for desktop & img for mobile

## 2 Quiz pg
    Created:
        *Timer
        *Score
        *Progress Bar
        *Questions and responses (5 total, rotating random)
All are functional except for the Progress Bar, after many attempts came short in displaying a moving bar of completion.

## 3 Final pg
Had difficulty displaying final score. I am able to get the score and store in local storage. But cant access it to display on the final pg.
Kept playing with the script within final.html, but no luck. Will return to this at a later date.
Also contains a Save and Play again buttons.
